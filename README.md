#  Meta-Learning for Monitoring in Code Summarization Systems

### This is the code accompanying the research on Meta-Learning Monitoring (MLM) Module for Code Summarization Pipelines

This repo contains the Experiments 1-4 from the paper, as well as the code to load and preprocess the CoNaLa data from Huggingface.

Each experiment has their own virtual environment, please consult the respective metainfo.txt files
